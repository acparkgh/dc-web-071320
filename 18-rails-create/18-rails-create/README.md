# Objectives

- Use both form_for and form_tag to generate forms
- Build a form to send get params, and interpret them in the controller
- Use strong params to check for allowed form fields
- Create a new resource using form_for

# Questions

- how does resources in routes.rb work?
- how does 'get' work in routes?
- render vs redirect
- in forms, what is the path for?
- general confusion over punctuation
    - colons, double-colons
- route prefix, "as"


as: "whatever" provides the prefix to be used for your route helpers

form_tag: generic form, multi-purpose
form_for: when the fields on your form match columns in your database
